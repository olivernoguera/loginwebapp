By default application contains users  with username "USER_i" with password "PASS_i" 1 <= i <= 3.

Then there are USER_1, USER_2 and USER_3 with passwords PASS_1, PASS_2 and PASS_3.

Each user have role with PAGE_i, so USER_1 have role to PAGE_1.

All users have special role "API" whose purpose is using to read api rest.

Also exists one special user with adminitration role(ADMIN,ADMIN) with role WRITER_API with write access to
Api rest.

If authentication is not valid endpoints returns 401 status (Unathorired).

Only user with role with writeAccess can use delete, put and post methods. By default ADMIN user.

If you try use not read method with users has not role with writeAccess API returns 403 httpstatus.
